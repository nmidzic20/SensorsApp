//1. user presses button Check sensor

//2. click triggers function which sends POST request to start checking process, POST carries sensorId which is saved in business key of the started process

//3. ExternalTaskWorker is on all the time in background, will catch when the first external task sensor-status becomes active, and will
//at that point make GET request to get sensor functionality variable, boolean isWorking as true or false
//the fetched variable is set for the task, to allow the process determine which way to go next, and the task is completed

//4. The process moves on either to end or to the second external task, at which point ExternalTaskWorker catches it and sens POST to notify endpoint,
//which then via hub alerts frontend that email needs to be sent, frontend sends email - POST carries sensorId and message, which need to be defined in ExternalTaskWorker
//and will be carried to backend, then to frontend (sensorId we get in ExternalTaskWorker from business key of the active process))

//of course, the question is why even send POST to backend, when we could just send email as soon as the second external task is caught here... - but since this script is 
//separate from frontend, can't access mail services defined in frontend - this script deals only with the access to Camunda process & sending requests to backend

//5. frontend sends email alert
